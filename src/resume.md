## Experience ##
### Zebra Technologies (Formerly Fetch Robotics) ###
::: TestDiv
**Senior Robotics Engineer** (May 2022-Present)

 - Proposed, designed, implemented and documented the robots behavior formalizing interactions between features and complying with the R15.08 standard.
 - Lead cross-functional workshops to decide a standard *C++* Networking Pattern which would leverage newly developed infrastructure (Buff and Connect) while taking into account application and security requirements.
 - Worked with Technical Project Manager and other Tech Leads to build standardized process for ticketing.

**Robotics Engineer** (November 2021-May 2022)

 - Supported and developed features for internal core cloud robotics platform.
 - Documented common tasks and tribal knowledge.

### AutoRoboto at Deepmind (Formerly Google Brain) ###
::: TestDiv
**Research Engineer (SWE/Roboticist)** (January 2019 - March 2021)

- Built custom infrastructure for 3 robotic platforms and related hardware in *C++* and *Python* on *Linux*.
- Provided robotics and infrastructure subject matter expertise to researchers on a variety of robotic research projects.
- Lead integration to replace custom research team infrastructure with
standardized infrastructure, taking advantage of larger tooling efforts. 
- Reviewed and contributed to 4 papers published at the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).
:::
### Conference on Reinforcement Learning (CoRL) 2020 ###
::: TestDiv
**Video Proceedings Co-Chair** (November 2020)

- Wrote video standards and coordinated 165 submissions within a two week timeframe.
<!-- - Automated processing of videos and generation of YouTube descriptions with *Python* scripts. -->
:::

### Oregon State University ###
::: TestDiv
**Graduate Research Assistant**, Personal Robotics Group, Oregon State University (September 2016 - November 2018)

<!-- - Conducted research into self-driving wheelchairs using real world constraints such as cost and usability.  -->
<!-- - Competed in an international competition in Dubai. -->
<!-- - Demoed the self-driving wheelchair to the wheelchair manufacturer in Sweden.  -->
<!-- - Improved uptimes and reliability of the hardware by improving the interfaces written in *C++*, *Python* and *Robot Operating System (ROS)*.  -->
<!-- - Redesigned the onboard network, reducing cost, complexity and bulkiness while adding wireless connectivity for debugging and remote access. -->
- Developed a wheelchair serial driver in *C++* and *ROS* removing the need for a Raspberry Pi and custom PCB. 
- The improvements in the networking hardware and implementation of the serial driver greatly reduced the system footprint and brought installation time down from 45 minutes to 5 minutes. 
- Added logging to Go Baby Go Project (low-cost mobility platforms for infants with
disabilities) in collaboration with the Kinesiology department, unblocking data collection for on going research.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant**, Senior Level Instrumentation and Measurements, OSU (Fall 2017, Winter 2018)

- Taught student labs in a one-on-one setting, as well as group settings (groups of 30). Material covered Electrical Fundamentals, Arduino Programming, and Sensor Integration.
