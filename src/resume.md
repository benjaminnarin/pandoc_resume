Experience
---------
**SWE/Roboticist**, AutoRoboto at Google Research (January 2019 - March 2021)

- Built custom infrastructure for 3 robotic platforms and related hardware in *C++* and *Python* on *Linux*.
- Provided robotics and infrastructure subject matter expertise to researchers on a variety of robotic research projects.
- Lead integration to replace custom research team infrastructure with
standardized infrastructure, taking advantage of larger tooling efforts. 
- Reviewed and contributed to 4 papers published at the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

**CoRL 2020: Video Proceedings Co-Chair** (November 2020)

- Wrote video standards and coordinated 165 submissions within a two week timeframe.
- Automated processing of videos and generation of YouTube descriptions with *Python* scripts.

**Graduate Research Assistant**, Personal Robotics Group, Oregon State University (September 2016 - November 2018)

- Conducted research into self-driving wheelchairs using real world constraints such as cost and usability. 
- Competed in an international competition in Dubai.
- Demoed the self-driving wheelchair to the wheelchair manufacturer in Sweden. 
- Improved uptimes and reliability of the hardware by improving the interfaces written in *C++*, *Python* and *Robot Operating System (ROS)*. 
- Redesigned the onboard network, reducing cost, complexity and bulkiness while adding wireless connectivity for debugging and remote access.
- Developed a wheelchair serial driver in *C++* and *ROS* removing the need for a Raspberry Pi and custom PCB. 
- The improvements in the networking hardware and implementation of the serial driver greatly reduced the system footprint and brought installation time down from 45 minutes to 5 minutes. 
- Added logging to Go Baby Go Project (low-cost mobility platforms for infants with
disabilities) in collaboration with the Kinesiology department, unblocking data collection for on going research.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant**, Senior Level Instrumentation and Measurements, OSU (Fall 2017, Winter 2018)

- Taught student labs in a one-on-one setting, as well as group settings (groups of 30). Material covered Electrical Fundamentals, Arduino Programming, and Sensor Integration. 
- Coordinated and provided scoping and support for 38 unique group projects for a class of 126 students.

**Electrical Engineering Intern**, SuitX (June 2016 - September 2016)

- Redesigned and updated 14 custom PCBs in *EagleCAD* for both medical and industrial exoskeletons.
- Established the workflow and standards for electrical design and validation for the company.
- Manually consolidated multiple divergent part libraries into a centralized version controlled library. 
- Wrote standard operating procedure for concurrent PCB development.
- Added version control and release procedures to system PCBs for future traceability between PCB and designs.
- Designed, built and supported the company network. 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant**, Personal Robotics Group,Oregon State University  (June 2013 - May 2016)

- Initiated research and began development on a self driving wheelchair project. 
- Designed, built and evaluated several iterations of a self driving wheelchair, including taking the system to Boston and Santa Cruz to work with ALS patients for real world testing.

**Electrical Team Lead**, Oregon State Mars Rover Team (October 2011 - July 2013)

- Led a team of four to design and fabricate the electronics and RF system for the 2011-2013 OSU Mars Rover.

Education
---------
- **Masters of Science: Robotics**, Oregon State University, Advisor Dr. William Smart (2018)

    Researched semi-autonomous wheelchairs for people with extreme physical disabilities (ALS, Quadriplegia and SMA).

- **Bachelor of Science: Computer Science**, Oregon State University (2016)

- **Bachelor of Science: Electrical Engineering**, Oregon State University (2016)
